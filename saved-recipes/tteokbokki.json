      "steps": [
        "Add the water, dried anchovies, and dried kelp to a shallow pot or pan.",
        "Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat without the lid.",
        "In a separate pot, boil the eggs for 7-8 minutes, or longer if preferred.",
        "Combine gochujang (hot pepper paste), gochugaru (hot pepper flakes), and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies from the pot and add the rice cake, the mixture in the bowl, the green onion, and hard boiled eggs.",
        "Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts to boil. Let it simmer and keep stirring until the rice cake turns soft and the tteokbokki sauce thickens and looks shiny, which should take about 10 to 15 minutes. If the rice cake is not soft enough, add more water and continue stirring until it softens.",
        "Remove from the heat and serve hot. Add cheese and/or parsley flakes if desired."
